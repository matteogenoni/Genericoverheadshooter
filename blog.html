        <br>
        <p>In the first (and quite possibly last) venture of MMJ Entertainment, come and experience our simple action packed roguelike pixelated shooter, reminiscent of and very inspired by certain titles such as Enter The Gungeon and Hotline Miami. Maze and Destruction seeks to scratch that simple exciting itch that so few games nowadays can capture. Just blasting away mindlessly at whatever comes your way, and just never stopping has been frowned upon recently in the gaming community in favor of complex and well thought out and developed game mechanics, but hey, there’s nothing wrong with just having some dumb fun every once and a while. And that’s exactly what MMJ Entertainment plans to provide.
